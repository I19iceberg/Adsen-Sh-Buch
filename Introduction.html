    <h2>I, Aturk Sen Paul, being of sound mind and body, do hereby declare this to be my last will and testament.</h2>
    <p>I appoint my wife and children as the executors of this will. I give, devise, and bequeath all of my property, both real and personal, wherever located, to my wife and children, to be divided among them in such proportions as they may agree upon. If they are unable to agree, then such property shall be divided equally among them.</p>
