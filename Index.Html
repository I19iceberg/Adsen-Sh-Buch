    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>I, Aturk Sen Paul, being of sound mind and body, do hereby make and publish this as my last will and testament. I declare that I am revoking all prior wills and codicils.</p>
    <p>I am a resident of Istanbul, Turkey, but I currently reside with my son in California, USA. I hold both Turkish and American citizenship. I have substantial properties and assets in both countries, as well as in other countries around the world.</p>
    <h2>General Provisions</h2>
    <p>I direct my executor to pay all my just debts, funeral expenses, and the expenses of administering my estate, as soon as possible after my death.</p>
    <p>I direct that no bond be required of my executor.</p>
    <p>I declare that I am married and my spouse's name is Selin Paul. In the event of my spouse's predeceasing me, or if we are divorced at the time of my death, then all provisions in this will for my spouse shall be of no effect.</p>
